# Election_Analysis
The purpose of this project is to find out  voter turnout for each county, the percentage of votes from each county out of the total count and the county with the highest turnout. I'll use Python to create a program which will help to automate votes count.

## Election-Audit Results:

- There were a total of 369,711 votes.
- The number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct were the following: 
Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855)
Denver: 82.8% (306,055)
Arapahoe: 6.7% (24,801)
- Denver had the largest number of votes.
- The number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received were the following:
Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)
Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)
- Winner of the election was  Diana DeGette
Her Winning Vote Count was  272,892
Her Winning Percentage was  73.8%

I saved this data into the .txt file and also displayed it in the Terminal.

## Election-Audit Summary
This code can be used to get the same metrics for any other election data: get a winner name, the total number of votes, the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county, county with the largest number of votes, percentage and total number of votes for each candidate. 
This script can be modified to provide more detailed information on the votes count for each candidate in each county. 
This  script can also be used  for a big company president election by modifying the county votes to the departments names.
